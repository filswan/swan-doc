# Lagrange

​[Lagrange](https://lagrange.computer) is a decentralized Web3 platform for natural language processing (NLP) development and deployment, built on Swan Chain computing network. It aims to provide a more cost-effective, secure, and interoperable alternative to centralized cloud services like AWS.Lagrange serves as a decentralized version of Hugging Face, leveraging the decentralized computing resources from Swan Chain and utilizing multichain.storage as the decentralized storage layer to ensure the persistence of important data.
