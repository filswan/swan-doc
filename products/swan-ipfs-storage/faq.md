# Swan IPFS Storage FAQ

## What is a CID?
A CID (Content Identifier) is a unique hash used by IPFS to reference files. Use it to retrieve or share your files.

## How do I access my files?
- Use the Swan IPFS Storage Portal or API
- Use any public IPFS gateway (e.g., https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<cid>)

## Is my data private?
Files on IPFS are public by default. Use encryption for sensitive data before uploading.

## How long are files stored?
Files are stored as long as providers pin them. For guaranteed persistence, use Swan's pinning and backup features.

## Can I delete files?
You can unpin files you uploaded, but if others have pinned them, they may remain accessible on the network.
