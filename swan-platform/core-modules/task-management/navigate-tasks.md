# Navigate Tasks

**Browse Tasks** shows all available tasks that are open for bids on Swan.

* If you are a miner looking for tasks to bid on, this would be the place to look.
* As a client, after you create a task that is open for bids, it will be displayed on Browse Tasks.

**My Task** displays all tasks that only you have created as a client or tasks you have completed as a miner.

To switch between client and miner, click on the "**As Client**" or "**As Miner**" buttons at the top of the page.
