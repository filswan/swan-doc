Multichain computing protocol(MCP) is an open-sourced standard for developers to easily build secure multi-chain services and applications. With a universal bridging interface, developers can utilize resources across multiple blockchain networks including computing, storage, and bandwidth, eliminating the need for developers to write agile code for fast cross-chain integrations. MCP opens a new category of web3 applications that can be built by developers for multi-chain ecosystems.

**Protocol Requirements**

In order to enable a new class of web3 native dApps, a Decentralized Query Protocol must meet the following requirements:

1. Web3 Resource Discovery:  client should be able to get the web3 resources with minimum effort on the network
2. Data availability: a client should be able to pay to keep the data available for running queries against specific data sources.&#x20;
3. Price efficiency: clients should be able to pay for data, bandwidth, and computing resource availability in efficient and competitive marketplaces.&#x20;
4. Incentive alignment—incentives should be aligned between clients, providers, and dApp de- velopers to encourage growth of the network and positive network effects.&#x20;

## Protocol Layers

1\. [Cross-chain Consensus Layer](broken-reference)—responsible for smart contract execution and payment settlement.

2\. [Peer-to-peer (P2P) Network](peer-to-peer-p2p-network.md)—defines how nodes locate and connect.

3\. [Payment Channels](payment-channels.md) —facilitates fast and low-cost payments in the system.

4\. [Service Discovery](service-discovery.md)  – Server nodes and reputation module for public service

5\. [Data Marketplace ](data-marketplace.md)— the mechanism by which users pay nodes for the dataset.

6\. [Indexing and Caching Marketplace](indexing-and-caching-marketplace.md) — the mechanism by which users pay nodes for indexing and caching data sources.

7.[Web3 Task Auction](web3-task-auction.md) – public and private task, market matcher, auto bidding

8.[Storage Layer](storage-layer.md) — data stored on public blockchains or content addressable networks.

9\. [Computing Layer ](computing-layer.md)— how a query is routed to a specific node for computing.

10.[CDN Layer ](cdn-layer.md)– how data is distributed and hosted on the global network

11\. [Governance](governance.md) —manages schemas, treasure, and disputes.
