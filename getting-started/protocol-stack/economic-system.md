# Economic System

### SWAN Economics Overview

**1. SWAN Treasure DAO:**

* **Staking Rewards**: SWAN token holders who stake their tokens are rewarded, promoting long-term commitment and network security.
* **Investment Initiatives**: Funds accumulated through staking can be invested in opportunities that align with SWAN's goals, ensuring financial growth.
* **Community Building**: Funds are allocated to foster community growth, including educational programs, outreach campaigns, and partnerships.
* **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: Nodes or providers receive a UBI, ensuring a steady income, especially for those who might not secure regular jobs.
* **Network Tasks & Creator Rewards**: This promotes a vibrant ecosystem where creators are incentivized to contribute.
* **Budget Allocation**: Ensures a balanced and sustainable financial strategy.

**2. Tokenomics:**

* **SWAN Token**: Serves as the primary medium of exchange within the network. It's used for staking, rewards, and transaction fees.
* **Staking**: Token holders can stake their SWAN tokens to earn rewards and participate in network governance.
* **Token Burn**: A mechanism can be implemented where a portion of the tokens used in transactions is burned, reducing the overall supply and potentially increasing scarcity and value.

**3. Compensation Mechanism:**

* **Job Creators**: They are compensated, especially when the UBI rate exceeds the set target, incentivizing more job placements in the system.
* **Nodes/Providers**: If a node's job income is less than the UBI, they receive both the job income and the UBI. If the job income surpasses the UBI, only the job income is received.

**4. Governance:**

* **Committee**: Comprises token holders, core developers, builders, and other contributors. They decide on fund allocation, network tasks, and other major decisions.
* **Voting**: Token holders can participate in voting on proposals, changes, or decisions affecting the network.

**5. Incentive Structure:**

* **Network Growth**: As the network grows and more jobs are placed, nodes/providers are incentivized to take up more jobs rather than relying solely on UBI.
* **Proof of Eligibility**: To receive UBI, providers must prove they own the hardware they claim, ensuring genuine participation.

**6. System Jobs & Creator Rewards:**

* **Network Tasks**: Created to ensure the network remains active, especially when the UBI rate is higher than the target.
* **Creator Rewards**: Job creators are rewarded for placing jobs in the system, especially when there's a deficit of jobs.

**7. Regulatory Compliance & Security:**

* **Decentralized Nature**: Ensures tamper-proof and secure storage of data.
* **Compliance**: While the network operates autonomously, it may still need to adhere to regional or global regulations, especially concerning financial transactions.

The SWAN Economics is designed to create a balanced ecosystem where all participants, from token holders to job creators, are incentivized to contribute positively to the network's growth and sustainability.
