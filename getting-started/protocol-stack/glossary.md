# Glossary

* **Swan Chain:** A Layer 2 blockchain network that enhances the capabilities of an underlying blockchain (like Ethereum) for decentralized computing and storage, offering scalability and efficiency.
* **UBI (Universal Basic Income):** A feature within Swan Chain that ensures providers receive a minimum payment, encouraging consistent availability of decentralized services.
* **Provider:** Entities or individuals contributing computing resources to the Swan Chain, capable of participating in network tasks and eligible for UBI.
* **Public Service Jobs:** Tasks generated by Swan Chain to maintain provider engagement and system stability, especially when the UBI distribution is higher than a set target.
* **Creator Grants:** Rewards issued by Swan Chain for contributing new tasks or services, promoting innovation and expansion within the network.
* **Reputation Score:** A metric used within Swan Chain to assess the performance and reliability of providers, potentially influencing their eligibility for UBI and tasks.
* **Block Time:** The time interval Swan Chain takes to finalize and add a new set of transactions to the blockchain.
* **Blacklist:** A registry on Swan Chain of providers who have been deemed unreliable or who have failed to secure jobs within a specific timeframe, affecting their network privileges.
* **zk-proof (Zero-Knowledge Proof):** A cryptographic technique used on Swan Chain that allows a party to prove possession of certain information without revealing the information itself, enhancing privacy and security.
* **Treasure DAO:** The decentralized autonomous organization on Swan Chain tasked with managing funds and allocations for UBI, network tasks, and creative incentives.
* **Committee:** A group within Swan Chain, likely comprising stakeholders like token holders and developers, responsible for decision-making regarding fund management and network governance.
* **Staking Reward:** Incentives provided to participants who lock their tokens as a form of security or investment in Swan Chain, supporting its operations.
* **Target UBI Rate:** The desired proportion of providers receiving UBI within Swan Chain. If exceeded, additional network tasks may be generated to balance the system.
* **Average Job Duration:** The typical length of time a task or job takes to be completed by a provider on Swan Chain.
* **Job Price:** The amount of compensation set for the completion of a specific task within Swan Chain.
* **Swan AP (Accounts Payable) and Swan AR (Accounts Receivable):** Financial terms adapted for Swan Chain, indicating modules that manage outgoing and incoming transactions, respectively.
* **Swan Hub:** A central node or sector within Swan Chain that facilitates interactions and transactions between users and providers, possibly through regional hubs.
