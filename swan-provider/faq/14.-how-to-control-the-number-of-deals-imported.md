# 14. How to control the number of deals imported?

Two configuration file parameters can be used to control the number of deals imported: `max_sealing` and `max_addPiece`.

`max_sealing` includes the upper limit of the number of sectors in six sealing statuses: "Transferred", "Published", "Packing", "WaitDeals", "PreCommit1" and "SealPreCommit1Failed".&#x20;

`max_addPiece` is the upper limit for the AddPiece status.

The Swan Provider will monitor the sealing process of miners. When either `max_sealing` or `max_addPiece` reaches the set value, the Swan Provider will stop importing deals to Boost.\


{% hint style="info" %}
This configuration will only take effect when market\_version is 1.2 (i.e., it will only be active when SP is accepting orders through Boost V2)
{% endhint %}
