Swan Chain(formerly FilSwan), built as an Ethereum Layer 3 solution, is designed to enhance decentralized computing networks. It integrates a tool suite that streamers developers' access to resources across multiple blockchains.

The Swan network streamlines storage provider selection and data management. Meanwhile, multichain.storage enables seamless integration from IPFS to the Filecoin network. Additionally, Lagrange Dao provides a web3-oriented source code management platform powered by cross-chain computing. Swan network offers a comprehensive ecosystem that serves as a powerful tool for seamless storage, payment gateway integration, and decentralized computing.

## 1.1. Motivation

On May 22, 2010, the first Bitcoin transaction was made by exchanging 10,000 mined BTC for two pizzas delivered from a local pizza restaurant in Florida. Ethereum was initially described in late 2013 in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin. Since then, the blockchain’s goal is not just a peer-to-peer coin but also a global computer as Ethereum described.

As of day, we already have over 9000 tokens on coinmarketcap.com, with more than 500 SDKs. It became a huge challenge to the developer when they start the _Decentralized Applications (dApps)_ development. A typical web3 website development requires the developer to have the following prerequisite:

* EVM compatible or not
* Payment channel: Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, Solona
* Storage layer: Filecoin, IPFS, Arweave
* Computing layer: ICP, Akash
* Domain Name: ENS, Bonfida

Developers are currently bogged down with the intricacies of managing tokens and navigating various SDKs, diverting their focus from the primary features of their products. The lack of tools that facilitate easy access to web3 applications hinders the efficient creation of dApps. This not only slows down product development but also limits the economic potential of the decentralized application landscape.

FilSwan offers a comprehensive solution to this challenge by providing an infrastructure layer for Web3, the next-generation web application stack. It introduces a cross-chain consensus layer for dApps, enabling developers to utilize cross-chain tools and seamlessly access web3 resources across multiple blockchain networks. These tools encompass payment channels and web3 infura, streamlining the development process. By integrating economic incentives, FilSwan ensures a thriving ecosystem, paving the way for more efficient dApp creation and unlocking vast economic opportunities.
